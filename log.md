### Day 1: Monday January 3, 2022 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Went over old scripts that I wrote about a year ago to re teach myself types of variables and functions and whatnot. 

**Thoughts:** I defenetly have a long way to go learning how to use Github as well as scripting and writing code. That being said I am excited to see how this goes.

**Link to work:** Havent learned how to input this yet. Also havent really made anything worth while.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
