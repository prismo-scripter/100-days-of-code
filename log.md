# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday January 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Went over old scripts that I wrote about a year ago to re teach myself types of variables and functions and whatnot. 

**Thoughts:** I defenetly have a long way to go learning how to use Github as well as scripting and writing code. That being said I am excited to see how this goes.

**Link to work:** Havent learned how to input this yet. Also havent really made anything worth while.



### Day 2: Tuesday January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tested and messed around with len() as well as .find. Started writing a script that will convert IPv4 into Binary

**Thoughts**: Relearning how to use len() and .find was pretty fun due to its stimulus. For the script that I started to write I was able to ask for an input of an IP address as well as create three variables indexing for every dot.

**Link(s) to work**: To-do



### Day 3: Wednesday January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finised writing yesterdays lab that converted IPv4 into Binary

**Thoughts** I thought of a few tools I would like to develop using python. I realised I can leverage this challange into developing IT services that I can offer to future clients.

### Day 4: Thursday January 6, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I didnt activiely code all that much today I was messing around with the range function and wrote a simple loop

**Thoughts:** I spent more time looking at tiktok videos on python then actually writing python code but ultimately I think I made some progress non the less.

### Day 6: Friday January 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**:  I created a list called "Classroom" as well as a for loop with a range *7* to append() with another loop to represent students. I tried to replace integeres with actual names but am yet to be succesful.  

**Thoughts:** It is quite frustrating trying to get this loop to show strings that represnt students instead of integers. I started reading up on some of the data structures to see if I could find a way to accomplish my goal. However, it has been quite along day so I think itll be best to take a break and try again in the morning.
